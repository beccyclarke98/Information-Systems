Please open each section to see the progression, the purpose of the assignment is to provide you with an opportunity for learning, and us with a means of assessing your learning. As such, the aim is not for you to get the system built as quickly as possible, but rather to develop a system in a safe environment that encourages experimentation and learning. You should continually be questioning your approach to the work and trying to find the best way of developing systems through research and experimentation.

This assignment is group work and therefore each section is labelled with the group members name of the section they completed or if it was completed as a group no name is mentioned.
